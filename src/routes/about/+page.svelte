		"Today's foundation models are limited by data that lacks depth and discernment. Generalist annotators struggle to evaluate aesthetics, tone, intent, or narrative continuity across modalities. While AI grows more powerful, it still can't reason with the nuance that separates good from great—the kind of judgment that makes human creativity irreplaceable.",
		"That's where Verita comes in. We work with seasoned creative professionals—from film editors to designers to poets—to teach AI models how to reason like humans do, across text, image, audio, and video. Founded by ex-Scale AI builders, our team understands exactly what's missing from today's data pipelines. We've rebuilt annotation from the ground up with tools and workflows designed for subjective reasoning.",
		"We're not just improving training data—we're unlocking AI's creative potential. Leading model labs work with Verita to push the frontier of human-like reasoning, teaching their models more than just facts. We're helping them teach judgment, taste, and the subtle distinctions that turn artificial intelligence into something that truly understands the human experience."
